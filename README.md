This is a basic HTML and CSS website project consisting of three web pages:

index.html – The main landing page of the website.

CSSTABLE.html – A page that displays styled tables using CSS.

cssform.html – A page that showcases a styled form created with HTML and CSS.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental web development skills using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a practice project for structuring a website, applying styles, and creating interactive elements like forms and tables. No JavaScript or external frameworks are used in this project.
